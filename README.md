# Unofficial Zomato Python wrapper

## Problem

[Developer Zomato API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) is a great initiative by Zomato, the only issue is it's not _Available_ to developers, not for even basic use. That's a *Problem*.

## Intent

The motivation behind this project is to see if we can give the same functionality proposed by Zomato with the power of Web Scraping.
